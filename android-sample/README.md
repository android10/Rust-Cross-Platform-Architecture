## Rust Cross Platform Development: Android Sample

In order to **get started,** please refer to the the following **article/post** I have written:

- [Rust cross-platform... The Android part...](https://fernandocejas.com/blog/engineering/2023-07-27-rust-cross-platform-android/).

## The Idea

**A picture worth a thousand words!** Here is a summary of what this repo tries to accomplish:

</p>

### Running this project

1. Install the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Install the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/).
3. Open Android Studio and import the `build.gradle.kts` file as a new project.
4. Run the App.

### Local Development

 - If you want to **re-build the rust part,** please go to the [`rust-library`](../rust-library) folder and check the [available commands and documentation](../rust-library#cryptor_jni) over there.
